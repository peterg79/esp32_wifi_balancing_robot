    <p>After clicking upload it will take some time for the file to firstly upload and then be written to LittleFS,
        there is no indicator that the upload began. Please be patient.</p>
    <p>Once uploaded the page will refresh and the newly uploaded file will appear in the file list.</p>
    <p>If a file does not appear, it will be because the file was too big, or had unusual characters in the file name
        (like spaces).</p>
    <p>You can see the progress of the upload by watching the serial output.</p>
